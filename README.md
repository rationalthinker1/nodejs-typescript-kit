[Postlight](https://postlight.com)'s Node.js + TypeScript Starter Kit is a zero-config codebase that lets you start writing code immediately. It includes:

* TypeScript (or write just regular ol' JavaScript)
* Jest for testing
* Prettier for formatting
* ESLint for linting
* CircleCI configs
* Pre-commit hooks
* Basic config and build scripts

Read all about it [this handy introduction](https://postlight.com/trackchanges/introducing-postlights-node-js-typescript-starter-kit).

## Creating a project

Create the project by using **npx**:

_[npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) comes with npm 5.2+ and higher_

```bash
npx rationalthinker1/node-typescript-starter-kit my-awesome-project

cd my-awesome-project
```

Install dependencies using either **yarn** or **npm**

```bash
yarn install

#  or

npm install
```

And you can directly start coding!

## Starter Kit Documentation

### Development

For development, we'll assume you're using `yarn`, but if you're using `npm` instead, adjust the commands appropriately (namely, replace `yarn` with `npm run`).

For running an individual `.ts` file:

```bash
yarn ts-node <file.ts>
```

For development mode:

```bash
yarn nodemon
```

[nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) will automatically restart the application when file changes are detected. This is useful if the tool you're building executes code when run.

### Linting

```bash
yarn lint
```

VSCode users should add this to their workspace settings to integrate JS/TS linting in general:

```json
  "eslint.validate": [
    "javascript",
    "typescript",
  ]
```

### Running tests

Run all tests:

```bash
yarn test
```

Run and watch all tests:

```bash
yarn test:watch
```

### Building the App

```bash
yarn build
```

## Building your app with CircleCI

Having already pushed your project to your favorite git repository hosting service, you're one click away from integrating your app with CircleCI.

- Login to [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/)
- On the left side menu, press `Add Projects`.
- Pinpoint your project and press `Set Up Project`.
- Choose `Linux` as the OS and `Node` as the language.
- Press `Start Building`, and you're all set! :tada:

CircleCI ensures that every commit is checked for errors before merging.
This basic setup runs `yarn lint`, `yarn test`, and `yarn build`.
